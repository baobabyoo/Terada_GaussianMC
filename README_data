Apologies for the delay!. Here I am sending what I promised in our meeting. I am attaching a .zip file with all the cuts (along major and minor axis) in B3, B6 and alpha for the 3 disks we discussed last time. I am also attaching a pdf with the plot of the cuts for reference. In the data files, from first to last column: 1) offset in arcsec**, 2) intensity in Jy/beam, 3) error or stand dev* (same unit as intensity), 4) beam major axis (arcsec), 5) beam minor axis (arcsec).


*Column 3) for the B3 or B6 cuts it corresponds to the standard deviation along the cut (which is 3 pixel wide). It is very very small. Maybe it would be better to use the rms of the image.
*Column 3) for alpha, it corresponds actually to the propagated error from the B3 and B6 maps. In the pdf of the plots there s a tiny vertical segment showing what is the systematic error due to flux calibration.
** positive offset corresponds to positive RA_offset with respect to the center. The center was always taken as the center obtained through a 2d gaussian fit of the whole structure in the B3 observations.
Here are the rms of the individual maps and the specific frequencies.

IRS 63:
rms_band3=6.7e-6 Jy/b  (99.94 GHz)
rms_band6=1.8e-5 Jy/b (227.56 GHz)

RCrA_IRS7B:
rms_band3=8.0e-6 Jy/b (100.05 GHz)
rms_band6=3.94e-5 Jy/b (225.39 GHz)

IRAS16293B:
rms_band3=2.067e-5 Jy/b (100 GHz)
rms_band6=1.8968e-4 Jy/b (223 GHz)

Let me know if you need any other info. I got your emails with the VLA data. Thank you!!!. I will be working tomorrow, but Iâ€™ll be out of the office from Wednesday until next Thursday :(. I will still be checking e-mails but will not have much access to my laptop.
